# 🧠 AI Training Snake Game

**A 2025 twist on the classic Snake game - become the AI you always wanted to be!**

Train your AI by consuming data in this Snake-themed learning adventure!

## 🎮 Game Overview

**AI Training Snake** puts a clever twist on the classic Snake game. Instead of just eating food, you're training an AI by consuming different types of data. As your AI gets smarter (higher IQ), it moves faster and your neural network grows!

Ever wondered what it feels like to be an AI learning from scratch? Now you can experience the journey from "Basic Chatbot" to "Super Intelligence" in this addictive Snake-inspired game!

## 🎯 Game Concept

- **Snake = AI being trained**
- **Food = Different types of data**
- **Score = IQ Level**
- **Length = Neural Network Size**
- **Speed = Learning Rate (increases with IQ)**

You're an AI model consuming different types of training data to grow your intelligence. As you grow smarter, you evolve through AI complexity levels: Basic Chatbot → Language Model → Multimodal AI → AGI Candidate → Super Intelligence. The game gets faster as your intelligence increases (representing increased processing speed). "Hallucination" occurs when you hit walls or contradict yourself (collision).

## 📊 Data Types

| Type | Color | IQ Points | Probability | Description |
|------|-------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 🟢 Basic Data | Green | +1 IQ | 70% | Common training data |
| 🟡 Quality Data | Yellow | +3 IQ | 20% | High-quality datasets |
| 🔴 Premium Data | Red | +10 IQ | 10% | Rare, premium training data (flashes!) |

## 🎮 Controls

- **⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️ Arrow Keys** - Move your AI
- **SPACE** - Pause/Resume game
- **SPACE/ENTER** - Restart after game over

## 🚀 How to Play

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the game:**
   ```bash
   python snake.py
   ```

3. **Train your AI:**
   - Move around to consume data
   - Avoid walls (AI hallucination!)
   - Avoid hitting yourself (AI confusion!)
   - Watch your IQ and neural network grow!

## ✨ Features

### Visual Effects
- **Brightness Gradient**: Snake gets brighter as IQ increases
- **Head Highlighting**: White outline on snake head
- **Premium Data Flash**: Red data flashes to grab attention
- **Neural Network Visualization**: Snake length represents network size
- **Circuit patterns** on body segments
- **Real-time intelligence tracking** and AI complexity levels

### Game Mechanics
- **Adaptive Speed**: AI moves faster as it gets smarter
- **Smart Growth**: Premium data makes the snake grow more
- **Pause System**: Training can be paused and resumed
- **High Score Tracking**: Persistent best IQ score
- **Classic arrow key controls**
- **Higher-value data types** are rarer but give bigger intelligence boosts

### AI Training Theme
- **Death = Training Failure**
  - Hit walls = AI hallucinated
  - Hit self = AI got confused
- **Growth = Learning**
  - Consuming data increases IQ
  - Neural network expands
- **Speed = Processing Power**
  - Smarter AI processes faster

## 🎨 Enhanced Features

This improved version includes:

- **Better Code Organization**: Clean class structure
- **Improved Visuals**: Gradient effects, better UI
- **Pause Functionality**: Space to pause/resume
- **Enhanced Game Over Screen**: Better feedback
- **Persistent High Scores**: Tracks your best performance
- **Visual Feedback**: Data type indicators, network size display
- **Smooth Gameplay**: 60 FPS with proper timing

## 🏆 Tips for High IQ

1. **Chase Premium Data**: Worth 10x basic data!
2. **Plan Your Route**: Don't trap yourself
3. **Stay Alert**: Speed increases make control harder
4. **Practice**: Neural networks need training time!

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Framework**: Pygame
- **Grid Size**: 40x40 cells
- **Window Size**: 800x800 pixels
- **Frame Rate**: 60 FPS
- **Save System**: High scores saved to `high_score.txt`

## 🎲 Game Balance

- **Base Speed**: 150ms between moves
- **Speed Increase**: 3ms faster per IQ point (max 100ms faster)
- **Minimum Speed**: 60ms between moves
- **Growth Rate**: 1 segment for basic/quality, 2 for premium

## 💡 Why This Game?

In 2025, AI is everywhere - but most people don't really understand how these models learn and grow. I wanted to create something that's both entertaining and educational, giving players a visceral sense of what it might feel like to be an AI consuming training data and becoming more capable.

The classic Snake gameplay loop is perfect for this: the constant growth, the increasing difficulty, the "just one more game" addiction. But now instead of just eating apples, you're absorbing human knowledge and becoming superintelligent!

**Try to reach Super Intelligence without hallucinating! 🚀**

Built with Python and Pygame. A fun weekend project that combines retro gaming with cutting-edge AI themes.
