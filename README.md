## 🎮 Game Overview

**AI Training Snake** puts a clever twist on the classic Snake game. Instead of just eating food, you're training an AI by consuming different types of data. As your AI gets smarter (higher IQ), it moves faster and your neural network grows!

Ever wondered what it feels like to be an AI learning from scratch? Now you can experience the journey from "Basic Chatbot" to "Super Intelligence" in this addictive Snake-inspired game!

## 🎯 Game Concept

- **Snake = AI being trained**
- **Food = Different types of data**
- **Score = IQ Level**
- **Length = Neural Network Size**
- **Speed = Learning Rate (increases with IQ)**

You're an AI model consuming different types of training data to grow your intelligence. As you grow smarter, you evolve through AI complexity levels: Basic Chatbot → Language Model → Multimodal AI → AGI Candidate → Super Intelligence. The game gets faster as your intelligence increases (representing increased processing speed). "Hallucination" occurs when you hit walls or contradict yourself (collision).

## 📊 Data Types

| Type | Color | IQ Points | Probability | Description |
|------|-------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 🟢 Basic Data | Green | +1 IQ | 70% | Common training data |
| 🟡 Quality Data | Yellow | +3 IQ | 20% | High-quality datasets |
| 🔴 Premium Data | Red | +10 IQ | 10% | Rare, premium training data (flashes!) |

## 🎮 Controls

- **⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️ Arrow Keys OR WASD** - Move your AI

### AI Training Theme
- **Death = Training Failure**
  - Hit walls = AI hallucinated
  - Hit self = AI got confused
- **Growth = Learning**
  - Consuming data increases IQ
  - Neural network expands
- **Speed = Processing Power**
  - Smarter AI processes faster

## 🏆 Tips for High IQ

1. **Chase Premium Data**: Worth 10x basic data!
2. **Plan Your Route**: Don't trap yourself
3. **Stay Alert**: Speed increases make control harder
4. **Practice**: Neural networks need training time!
5. **Use Both Control Schemes**: Switch between arrows and WASD as needed
6. **Watch for Achievements**: They provide goals and motivation
7. **Listen to Audio Cues**: Sound effects help you react faster

## 💡 Why This Game?

In 2025, AI is everywhere - but most people don't really understand how these models learn and grow. I wanted to create something that's both entertaining and educational, giving players a visceral sense of what it might feel like to be an AI consuming training data and becoming more capable.

The classic Snake gameplay loop is perfect for this: the constant growth, the increasing difficulty, the "just one more game" addiction. But now instead of just eating apples, you're absorbing human knowledge and becoming superintelligent!

**Try to reach Super Intelligence without hallucinating! 🚀**

Built with Python and Pygame. A fun weekend project that combines retro gaming with cutting-edge AI themes.
