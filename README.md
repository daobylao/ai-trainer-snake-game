**AI Training Data Snake 🤖🐍**
A 2025 twist on the classic Snake game - become the AI you always wanted to be!
About This Game
Ever wondered what it feels like to be an AI learning from scratch? Now you can experience the journey from "Basic Chatbot" to "Super Intelligence" in this addictive Snake-inspired game!

**🧠 The Concept**
You're an AI model consuming different types of training data to grow your intelligence
Each data type has different value: Text (1pt), Code (2pts), Images (3pts), Research (5pts), Multimodal (8pts)
As you grow smarter, you evolve through AI complexity levels: Basic Chatbot → Language Model → Multimodal AI → AGI Candidate → Super Intelligence
The game gets faster as your intelligence increases (representing increased processing speed)
"Hallucination" occurs when you hit walls or contradict yourself (collision)

**✨ Visual Features**

AI body gets more colorful as it grows smarter
Circuit patterns on body segments
Different colored data types with symbols
Real-time intelligence tracking and AI complexity levels

**🎮 Game Mechanics**
Classic arrow key controls
Higher-value data types are rarer but give bigger intelligence boosts
Dynamic game speed that increases with intelligence level
Comprehensive UI showing your progress and data type legend
Persistent high score tracking

**Why I Built This**
In 2025, AI is everywhere - but most people don't really understand how these models learn and grow. I wanted to create something that's both entertaining and educational, giving players a visceral sense of what it might feel like to be an AI consuming training data and becoming more capable.
The classic Snake gameplay loop is perfect for this: the constant growth, the increasing difficulty, the "just one more game" addiction. But now instead of just eating apples, you're absorbing human knowledge and becoming superintelligent!

**Try to reach Super Intelligence without hallucinating! 🚀**

Built with Python and Pygame. A fun weekend project that combines retro gaming with cutting-edge AI themes.
